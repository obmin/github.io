HTTP protocol and his secure version HTTPS are a ground of the entirely modern network and the Internet. Any other protocol can't provide such availability on the huge amount of devices, computers and operating systems from smart-watches, smart-TV and plenty of IoT devices to supercomputers on any kind of OS. All those devices join only one thing - the ability to communicate with the Universe of online services through the HTTP(S) protocol on top of the TCP/IP connection. Any other commercial or special protocol or service on top of HTTP couldn't guarantee same wide availability and functionality on all devices and OS. No matter if standards open, commercial or even ISO standards.
<p class="description">OBMIN is using the main network standard to provide an extremal availability and connectivity on all kind of devices.</p>

<img alt="" src="{{ "/assets/icons/private.png" | relative_url }}" align="left" style="margin:12px 48px 12px 0">
A local storage of your data and personal server give you that control without any exceptions on your data. Any online service can't guarantee a full privacy and have license agreements to avoid any responsibility. Only your rules and control on own data can give that privacy.
<p class="description">Nothing is changed. Privacy is a matter of your own.</p>

# Security

<img alt="" src="{{ "/assets/icons/lock.png" | relative_url }}" align="left" style="margin:12px 48px 12px 0">
Latest security network standards give your the same quality level and security as any online public service. OBMIN Server is using your <b>personal unique TLS 1.2 certificates</b> generated by OpenSSL for secure <b>HTTPS</b> connections. You can regenerate a new certificate anytime or even get for free but for limited time (60 days) signed certificates through the <b>Let's Encrypt</b> initiative and select them in the network preferences. The server supports <b>Digest Authentication</b> - a modern security protocol for user authentication over HTTP. It's not exposing passwords for the user authorization, and with strong passwords makes very complicating hacking even on open HTTP connections. But it's strongly recommended to use long passwords on top of VPN services or HTTPS layer. In addition, more security and privacy gives openness of the project.
<p class="description">Latest security standards protect your data. Do not be embarrassed by browser warnings about your certificates when you're connecting to your own server. It is only matter when you are connecting to public servers or services. Personal unsigned certificates even could help to protect your privacy more than even signed. So they save your time and money.</p>
