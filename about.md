# Connectivity

![protocols]()

HTTP protocol and his secure version HTTPS are a ground of the entirely modern network and the Internet. Any other protocol can't provide such availability on the huge amount of devices, computers and operating systems from smart-watches, smart-TV and plenty of IoT devices to supercomputers on any kind of OS. All those devices join only one thing - the ability to communicate with the Universe of online services through the HTTP(S) protocol on top of the TCP/IP connection. Any other commercial or special protocol or service on top of HTTP couldn't guarantee same wide availability and functionality on all devices and OS. No matter if standards open, commercial or even ISO standards.
<p class="description">OBMIN is using the main network standard to provide an extremal availability and connectivity.</p>

# Privacy

A local storage of data gives you that control on your data. Any on-line can't guarantee a full privacy. Their technical staff, government agencies or other third sides can use your data against you. Even Internet browsers sell your meta-data but what's this anonymous meta-data? It's user profiles bound to their physical (MAC/IMEI)
and logical IP addresses with an information from time and geolocation to the detailed analyses of your data and requests. The newest trend is an analyzing with AI networks and can extract any kind of information like who you are and what do you think about.
<p class="description">Nothing is changed. Privacy is a matter of your own.</p>
