## The age of containers.
Today all are going to containers, microservices and clouds. Cause of that is the scaling of modern applications to millions/billions users. It's just impossible to build a single computer strong enough to achieve desired performance for running any classic applications. Other cause is continues integration (CI) for modern applications to delivery applications as fast as possible to users. Another thing is applications should be overcomplicated even from beginning to able running that competition with other products.

## Time to containers

Now we have own docker container too. It's a very first version and you couldn't get too many features from it. The project architecture was designed for personal desktop users and it will be so on. But this technology can give us extra features and cover more systems and environments. I think here's a place to grow and optimizations.

## How I could try it?
It's simple. OBMIN is available [on the DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/obmin/obmin/). So you can just use Docker CLI to find and install it.
```sh
# Install OBMIN Container
docker pull obmin/obmin
```
After you can run that container from any folder:
```sh
docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/obmin" -p 80:8088 -it obmin
```
That is now you can go to http://localhost and the contents of the current folder.
