OBMIN Server is an GPLv3-licensed open source project focused on desktop users. It's an independent project with its ongoing development made possible entirely thanks to the support by these awesome [backers](https://github.com/konkor/obmin/blob/master/BACKERS.md). You will also support my other interesting community projects. If you'd like to help the project and want to join to it, please consider:

## Donations
 I like completely open-source projects. It's why I picked GPLv3 license for my open projects. I think only such license could protect Desktop Users from Business Users. Maybe I'm a dreamer and want to believe in the pure projects but the reality is most projects and FOS organizations are sponsored by big business and founded by them.
 But real life is a hard thing and very complicated by many circumstances. I'm not young and all we have it's our life (time) and where we'll be tomorrow. Life is hard. I'd like it to work on my projects productively which want a lot of time and affords. Now I want get your support to have ability to support and develop projects.
